CERTIFICA TION
Certification Exam
Objectives
EXAM NUMBER: CORE 2 (220-1202)
Candidates are encouraged to use this document to help prepare for the CompTIA A+ 220-1202 certification
exam. In order to receive the CompTIA A+ certification, you must pass two exams: Core 1 (220-1201) and Core 2
(220-1202). The CompTIA A+ Core 1 (220-1201) and Core 2 (220-1202) certification exams will verify the
successful candidate has the knowledge and skills required to:
• Install, configure, and maintain computer equipment, mobile devices, and software for end users.
• Service components based on customer requirements.
• Understand networking basics and apply basic cybersecurity methods to mitigate threats.
• Properly and safely diagnose, resolve, and document common hardware and software issues.
• Apply troubleshooting skills and provide customer support using appropriate communication skills.
• Understand the basics of scripting, cloud technologies, virtualization, and multi-OS deployments in corporate
environments.
EXAM ACCREDITATION
The CompTIA A+ Core 1 (220-1201) and Core 2 (220-1202) exams are accredited by ANSI to show compliance
with the ISO 17024 standard and, as such, undergo regular reviews and updates to the exam objectives.
