## Discussion Questions

**Discussion Questions and Answers**

1. **Why is changing the default router password considered the most critical initial security step for SOHO networks?**
**Answer:** Default passwords are publicly known and widely documented, making routers with unchanged credentials vulnerable to immediate compromise. Attackers routinely scan for devices using default credentials, and successful access grants complete administrative control over the network. Changing the default password is the first line of defense that prevents unauthorized access to router configuration, network monitoring, and security settings. This single step eliminates one of the most common attack vectors against SOHO networks.

2. **How does port forwarding affect network security, and what precautions should be taken when implementing it?**
**Answer:** Port forwarding creates direct pathways from the internet to internal network devices, potentially exposing services to external attacks. While necessary for hosting services, it increases attack surface and bypasses firewall protection for forwarded ports. Precautions include forwarding only necessary ports, using non-standard port numbers, implementing strong authentication on exposed services, regular security monitoring, and keeping forwarded services updated with security patches.

3. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of MAC address filtering in SOHO environments?**
**Answer:** MAC filtering provides device-level access control and prevents unauthorized devices from connecting even with correct passwords. It's effective against casual intrusion attempts and provides an additional security layer. However, MAC addresses can be spoofed by determined attackers, the feature requires manual management of device lists, and it doesn't protect against attacks from authorized devices. MAC filtering works best as part of layered security rather than a standalone solution.

4. **How does DHCP configuration impact network performance and security in SOHO environments?**
**Answer:** Proper DHCP configuration ensures efficient IP address management and reduces configuration errors that could cause network conflicts. Security benefits include controlling the IP address range available to clients and configuring secure DNS servers. However, DHCP can be exploited through rogue DHCP servers or exhaustion attacks. Best practices include using appropriate lease times, reserving static IPs for critical devices, and monitoring DHCP client lists for unauthorized devices.

5. **Why is regular firmware updating crucial for SOHO router security, and what risks are associated with the update process?**
**Answer:** Firmware updates patch security vulnerabilities, fix bugs, and add new features that improve router functionality and protection. Outdated firmware often contains known vulnerabilities that attackers actively exploit. However, firmware updates carry risks including temporary network outages, potential device bricking if updates fail, and possible introduction of new bugs. Risk mitigation includes backing up configurations, updating during maintenance windows, and verifying update integrity before installation.
