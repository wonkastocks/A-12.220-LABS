## Discussion Questions

**Question 1:**

What are the advantages of using Task Manager and Resource Monitor for troubleshooting system performance issues in Windows?

**Answer:**

Task Manager provides a quick overview of running processes, CPU, memory, disk, and network usage, helping identify resource hogs and unresponsive applications. Resource Monitor offers deeper real-time analysis of system resources, allowing you to pinpoint which processes are using specific files, network ports, or causing disk bottlenecks. Together, they enable effective diagnosis and resolution of performance problems. (Objective 1.2)

**Question 2:**

How can command-line tools like ipconfig, netstat, and nslookup assist in network troubleshooting?

**Answer:**

`ipconfig` displays IP configuration and can release/renew DHCP leases. `netstat` shows active connections and listening ports, helping identify open or suspicious network activity. `nslookup` tests DNS resolution. These tools help diagnose connectivity issues, identify misconfigurations, and verify network status from the command line. (Objective 4.0)

**Question 3:**

What precautions should you take before editing the Windows Registry, and why is documentation important?

**Answer:**

Always back up the registry or create a system restore point before making changes, as incorrect edits can destabilize or disable Windows. Documenting changes allows for easier troubleshooting and recovery if issues arise, and ensures repeatability for future configurations. (Objective 1.4)

**Question 4:**

Describe how Group Policy can be used to enforce security and configuration settings across multiple computers in a Windows environment.

**Answer:**

Group Policy allows administrators to centrally manage settings such as password policies, software restrictions, and user permissions. Policies can be applied at the local, site, domain, or organizational unit (OU) level, ensuring consistent security and operational standards across all managed systems. (Objective 4.0)

**Question 5:**

Why is it important to use built-in Windows system tools like Disk Cleanup, Defragmenter, and System Configuration, and what risks are associated with improper use?

**Answer:**

These tools help maintain system health by freeing up disk space, optimizing performance, and managing startup processes. However, improper useâ€”such as deleting critical files or disabling essential servicesâ€”can lead to data loss or system instability. Always review actions and understand tool functions before applying changes. (Objective 1.2, 1.4)
